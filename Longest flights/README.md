# World's Longest Flights

Using data scraped from Wikipedia World's [Longest flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_flights) and Lat and Long from SimpleMaps [World Cities Database](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities),
I created a query to visualize the World's Longest flights in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jorge.supelano#!/vizhome/WorldsLongestFlights_16081464747450/Theworldslongestflights)

The original data was processed in Power Query. This query produces the same result
